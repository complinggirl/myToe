# myToe

This was a really fun TicTacToe project. It has an attractive UI that has lots of details such as score boards and deciding a first player and token at random. 
We added in a nice function that recognizes when a stalemate is inevitable (thanks Adam Thayer, our instructor for his input on this).

To use it, just download and open the .html file in the browser.
